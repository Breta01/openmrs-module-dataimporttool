<h2>Welcome to Data Import Tool </h2>

<p>The module aims ease data migration for production settings by improving upon an existing data migration tool to make it more user friendly.
This OpenMRS specific module integrates  the eSaude Data Migration Tool (eSaudeDMT) in order to migrate data from SQL-based data source into OpenMRS.
<br>It provides a WUI which takes Migration settings on the startMigration page replacing the old config.xml file of the DMT tool.
