{"name":"Openmrs-module-dataimporttool","tagline":"A system to migrate from SQL-based databases into OpenMRS","body":"### Welcome to Data Import Tool.\r\nThe goal of this project is to improve ease of data migration for production settings by improving upon an existing data migration tool to make it more user friendly.\r\nThe student will develop an OpenMRS specific module that either (a) reuses components from or (b) integrates  the eSaude Data Migration Tool (eSaudeDMT) it in order to migrate data from SQL-based data source into OpenMRS. The completed module will provide a WUI to configure migration settings that are currently being performed using an XML file (config.xml), and a command button to ignite the execution. \r\n\r\nyou can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/Ch3ck/openmrs-module-dataimporttool.git\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2015 Nyah Check@Ch3ck, as a Google Summer of code student was inspired by the eSaude Data Migration System developed by Pascal Brandt(psbrandt) and Valerio Joao(@vjoao) to work on the Data Import Tool for OpenMRS.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with our tool? Check out the documentation at https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/Data+Import+using+eSaude+Data+Migration+Tool or contact us on the openmrs mailing list(dev@openmrs.org) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
